I want to be able to make recommendations of what to layer based on these rules:
1. Balance Fragrance Notes: A well-layered perfume requires a delicate balance between top, middle, and base notes. Combining multiple dominant top notes may result in an overwhelming opening that quickly fades away. On the other hand, an excessive concentration of base notes can be cloying. Strive for a balanced blend that unfolds beautifully over time, showcasing each note at its best.
2. Wear the Most Powerful Scent as Your Base: Layering entails applying one fragrance before the other, so start with the strongest blend to allow the second (and third, and so on) to come to live. For example, perfume oils should be applied before traditional eau de parfum as they have a higher concentration of fragrance. If you’re using scents with equal fragrance oil percentages, apply the one that has the heavier scent first so the lighter one doesn’t get buried underneath it.
3. pair complementary notes based on the fragrance wheel, if they’re across from each other in the wheel, then they’re complimentary. 
4. pair either a bold, strong scent with a softer scent, or two soft scents. focus on either adding two relatively simple scents together or layering one complex scent with a lighter one.
